# WhoPlusYou-COOP-Coding-Challenge

This is a second solution of the coding challenge. In this solution, I used html, css, bootstrap, javascript, jquery, and php

To run the app:
1. Using the terminal, go to the php folder directory, then run "php -S localhost:8000" (not including "")
2. Open index.html
