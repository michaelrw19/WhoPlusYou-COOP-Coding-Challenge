# WhoPlusYou-COOP-Coding-Challenge

This is the first solution to the coding challenge. In this solution, I used React, CSS, Javascript (JSX syntax)

To run the app:
1. Using the terminal, go to the following directory: first solution\client\wpy-coop-coding-challenge
2. Run "npm install" (this takes some time, around 2 min)
3. Run "npm start"

4. Using the terminal, go to the following directory: first solution\server
5. Run "npm install"
6. Run "node index.js"

7. Open http://localhost:3000 or on your own network (shown when you run npm start) to view it in your browser.
